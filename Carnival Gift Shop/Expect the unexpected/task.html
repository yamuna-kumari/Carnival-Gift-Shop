<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>We made our program run continuously, but there is a problem, as you cannot handle any unexpected inputs! The visitor could enter a different number than you provide, or they could enter a character instead of a number. Now, we will handle these cases. </p>
<p>For the initial input, where you ask the visitors what to do, if the visitor enters anything unexpected, output <code class="java">Please enter a valid number!</code></p>
<p>For the <strong>first</strong> option, where the visitor chooses to buy a gift, handle these cases;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If there're no gifts left to buy, output: <code class="java">Wow! There are no gifts to buy.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are non-numeric characters in the input: <code class="java">Please enter a valid number!</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are no gifts with that number. Output this message: <code class="java">There is no gift with that number!</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the visitor doesnâ€™t have enough tickets to buy a gift: <code class="java">You don't have enough tickets to buy this gift.</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <strong>second</strong> option, where the visitor enters the number of tickets they want to add, handle these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>if they enter a non-numeric value.</li>
<li>the number they enter should be between <code class="java">0</code> and <code class="java">1000</code> (both inclusive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Output this message if <strong>any</strong> of these cases happen: <code class="java">Please enter a valid number between 0 and 1000.</code></p>
<p>For the <strong>last</strong> option, where you show the list of gifts, if there are no gifts left to offer, output this message again:<code class="java">Wow! There are no gifts to buy.</code></p>
<p>Following the previous stage, the program will run until the exit prompt is entered.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">isNaN</a> built-in method to check if an input is a number.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the welcoming and greeting messages from the previous stage;</li>
<li>Print the list of gifts;</li>
<li>Handle the initial input where the user chooses what to do and handle any unexpected inputs;</li>
<li>Handle the option to buy a gift and handle all of the cases mentioned above;</li>
<li>Handle the option to add more tickets to the total tickets and handle all of the cases mentioned above;</li>
<li>Handle the option to see the total tickets;</li>
<li>Handle the option to see the list of gifts and handle all of the cases mentioned above; </li>
<li>Handle the option to quit the program;</li>
<li>Run continuously;</li>
<li>Terminate the program the message.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
