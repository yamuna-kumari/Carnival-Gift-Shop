<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Now that you have the list of gifts with details, the visitors will decide what they want.</p>
<p>To simplify getting input from the console, we're using a JS library; check out the <a href="https://github.com/hyperskill/sync-input#usage" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a> to see how you can use it.</p>
<p>First, let’s get this input from the visitor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">What do you want to do?

1-Buy a gift 2-Add tickets 3-Check tickets 4-Show gifts</code></pre>
<p>The visitor will enter the respective number to choose an option. Also, the visitor will have <code class="java">100</code><strong> </strong>tickets in the beginning.</p>
<p>In the first option, we will ask for another input: <code class="java">Enter the number of the gift you want to get: </code></p>
<p>The visitor will enter the id/order number of the gift, and we will output the name of the gift: <code class="java">Here you go, one %GIFT_NAME%!</code></p>
<p>Then, we will subtract the ticket amount of the chosen gift from the visitor’s total tickets and show the total tickets: <code class="java">Total tickets: 90</code></p>
<p>In the second option, the visitor will enter the number of tickets to add with this input: <code class="java">Enter the ticket amount: </code></p>
<p>After that, we will show the total number of tickets again!</p>
<p>In the third option, let's show the total tickets that the visitor has: <code class="java">Total tickets: 90</code></p>
<p>And in the last option, show the list of gifts again like in the example!</p>
<p>After any of these cases, output this message before ending the program: <code class="java">Have a nice day!</code></p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the welcoming and greeting messages from the previous stage;</li>
<li>Print the list of gifts;</li>
<li>Handle the initial input where the user chooses what to do;</li>
<li>Handle the option to buy a gift;</li>
<li>Handle the option to add more tickets;</li>
<li>Handle the option to see the total tickets;</li>
<li>Handle the option to see the list of gifts;</li>
<li>Terminate the program with a new message.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
